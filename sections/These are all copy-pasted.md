These are all copy-pasted

All of these figures are copy-pasted into the index.html file.
When I started this I thought that surely HTML + CSS + Javascript would have a way to 
include other HTML files. Apparently not. 
For now I'll go down the copy-paste route because I am learning and 
want to limit the number of frameworks and external dependencies
(and also don't know which higher-level framework or language to commit to).

Future options include: 
- Static Site Generators (SSGs) like Next.js
- Server-side language like Php
- Other Javascript frameworks, such as React.
