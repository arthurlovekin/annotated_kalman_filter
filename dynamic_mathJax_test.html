<!--Notes:
Tried to update individual variables within the formula but I couldn't get it to work.
I tried writing formulas like $$<span id="state">x</state> = ...$$ but MathJax wouldn't recognize
    this as an equation to render. 
Reversing this, doing <span id="state">$$x$$</state> $$=$$ <span id="control_input">$$u$$</span>
also didn't work since a new line was made for each $$
Finally, I tried using MathJax macros so I could write $$\state = F \state$$ but this
    didn't work because when I tried to redefine the macros, it would no longer apply to the html
    (I think the html might have been changed on first rendering so a second pass didn't see the \state anymore)

It wasn't clear how to define the relationship between the Variables and the naming_convention, 
so I decided to use the variables as my single source of truth.
